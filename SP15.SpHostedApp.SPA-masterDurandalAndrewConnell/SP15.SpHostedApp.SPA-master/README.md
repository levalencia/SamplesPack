SP15.SpHostedApp.SPA
====================

A sample SharePoint 2013 app implemented as a SharePoint Hosted App using the Single Page App (SPA) pattern.

You can read more about this sample on my blog (http://www.andrewconnell.com/blog/sharepoint-hosted-apps-in-sp-2013-as-single-page-apps) and view the sample in action from my YouTube channel (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtbqVK7Ws3M).

Note there are multiple branches. At the present time the *master* branch is empty. The other branch, *DurandalJS* is another branch where this is implemented using the DurandalJS (http://durandaljs.com/) presentation framework.
