## Overview ##
This project is a Microsoft app for Office used in Word 2013 and Excel 2013. It helps you quickly access Wikipedia content from Office and simplifies the process of referencing text and images.  
The Wikipedia app will automatically search topics based on the selection in your Office document and display results in the Task Pane. Wikipedia content in the Task Pane is optimized for easy navigation and reading. Content is organized into sections, and tabs allow you to focus on text and images or just images.  
Inserting Wikipedia content is a snap: simply select the Wikipedia content you are interested in, and with one click the app will instantly insert a quotation into your document.

## Structure of the source code ##
In the project, Wikipedia_devWeb is responsible for UI handling and interaction with user, SandboxWeb is dedicated to calling Wikipedia APIs for search.
The communication between them depends on iframe postMessage with sandbox tag that makes the cross-domain communication possible. 

+ Wikipedia_devWeb that is responsible for UI handling, sending search keywords to SandboxWeb and receiving search results from SandboxWeb.

## APIs and libraries ##
1. `this.tryUpdatingSelectedWord = function (autoSearchIsOn, milliSecond)` at line 1222 in Wikipedia_ui.js  
If you want to use Office.context.document.getSelectedDataAsync to get the text selected by the user in Office client, you can refer to this. Please pay attention to the differences of string handling between Word & Excel.

2. `this.insertText = function (text)` at line 1317 in Wikipedia_ui.js  
If you want to use Office.context.document.setSelectedDataAsync to insert text into Office client, you can refer to this. Please pay attention to the differences of inserted content handling between Office.CoercionType.Html & Office.CoercionType.Text.

3. `this.insertImage = function (fullHTML)` at line 1331 in Wikipedia_ui.js  
&nbsp;You can refer to this for inserting image into Word.

__2.    Set up for debugging and run the Wikipedia app:__

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.    Start Visual Studio.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.    Launch the Wikipedia_dev project.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.    Update the URLs of Wikipedia_devWeb and Sandbox:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I.    Check the URL of Wikipedia_devWeb to make sure that it matches the wikipediaHostURL at line 277 of file sandbox.js.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;II.    Check the URL of Sandbox to make sure that it matches the sandBoxHostURL at line 278 of file Wikipedia_utils.js.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.    Click Start Debugging or press the F5 key.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I.   All the .js files started with Wikipedia_ will be compiled as one file Wikipedia_dev.js in the same folder when you start running. You can see it after clicking 'Show All Files'.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;II.  If you want to know how to compile several .js files into one file. You can check Project Properties - Compile - Build Events...  
`copy /b $(ProjectDir)\Scripts\Wikipedia_vars.js+$(ProjectDir)\Scripts\Wikipedia_utils.js+$(ProjectDir)\Scripts\Wikipedia_navigation.js+$(ProjectDir)\Scripts\Wikipedia_sandbox.js+$(ProjectDir)\Scripts\Wikipedia_tabs.js+$(ProjectDir)\Scripts\Wikipedia_ui.js $(ProjectDir)\Scripts\Wikipedia_dev.js`
