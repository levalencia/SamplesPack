## Apps for Office/SharePoint Introduction ##
**Apps for Office** are web applications that extend what a document, email message, or meeting request can do in Office.  
Run them in multiple environments like Office desktop applications, Office 365, and mobile browsers in the cloud or on your site.  
**Apps for SharePoint** are small, easy-to-use, stand-alone applications that solve a need for your users or business.
Site owners can install, upgrade, and uninstall them on their SharePoint sites without farm or site collection admin permissions.
