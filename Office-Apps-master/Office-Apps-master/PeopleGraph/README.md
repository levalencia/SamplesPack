### Overview ###
This is a project for a real Microsoft app for Excel that can be downloaded free from [Office Store](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/store/). The app is developed using TypeScript. It interacts with data in Excel 2013 via Office.js, and renders a chart on D3.js.

With a few clicks, you could show your data in a vivid way. The chart contains much more information so that it is easy for you to tell a story based on your Excel data.
