##Office 365 Client Libraries for Windows 8.1 Store Apps##

This example shows how to use Office 365 API's from within a Windows 8.1 Store App. 

By adding a new Connected Service to your Windows 8.1. Store App you'll receive a sample implementation for any kind of Office 365 Service. 

Because both, Windows 8.1 Store Apps and Office 365 API's are implemented using async/await pattern, you can easily call the API's from any kind of EventHandler or ViewModel.
